# Flask application calls external python module
Split PDF into single pages and download into folder
[ Live Demo ](https://github.io/alexwardill/PDF-Splitter/)

# pdf-splitter
Developing a small application to easily split pdfs into individual pages.

### The issue
University printing only easily allows for double sided printing for students...
This is impractical when printing out lots of music.

### Queries
Not sure what shape I want this product to take yet?
A Web app using Javascript (Is React overkill?) and Python to allow other students to easily use the service
OR
an application (.exe) to install and run whenever you want to split pdfs
OR
A Chrome/Browser extension
...meaning it has to run smoothly on all machines and I have to navigate the specifics of deploying an extension

Also I'm not sure if anything like this exists easily but can't hurt to make another...


# To Do
